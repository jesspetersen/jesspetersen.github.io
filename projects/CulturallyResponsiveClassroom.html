      <h2>THE CULTURALLY RESPONSIVE CLASSROOM | MAY - JULY 2018</h2>
      <div class="w3-justify">
        <p>The Culturally Responsive Classroom is an HTML5 Canvas application designed to support educators in New Zealand to constuct a more culturally responsive learning environment for their learners. it is intended as a way to make culturally responsive pedagogy more visible, and aid educators with real-life examples of culturally responsive environments. The project is complete and no ongoing development is expected.</p>
        <p>The Culturally Responsive Classroom was created in Adobe Animate CC as an HTML5 Canvas application powered by HTML5 Canvas code snippets. A conscious decision was made to create the application in HTML5 Canvas instead of Flash, because, despite my prior experience working with Flash (see <a href="SaviourOfKatar.html">Saviour of Katar</a>), I wanted to <a href="https://theblog.adobe.com/adobe-flash-update/">maintain accessibility</a> to the application for years to come. Working with Adobe Multimedia software after such a long time away from it gave me the opportunity to rebuilt my skills, and prepare for a time where I, perhaps inevitably, will be teaching HTML5 in my own classes. I was able to experiment with embedding external links in my application, and after a significant amount of time wasted working on frames, rediscovered the (indespensible) button symbol "up" and "down" states. It was worth the effort, and I am very pleased with the result overall. The application itself represents approximately 30 hours of work, and if future improvements were to be made, I'd love to add a quiz component, or more interactive features.</p>
        <p><u><b>Here's how to use "The Culturally Responsive Classroom":</b></u>
		      <ul>
			      <li>Click on the drawn images on the screen to open a page that will tell you about how the thing you clicked is showing cultural responsiveness</li>
            <li>Once an item is clicked on, you will have two options at the bottom right corner of the screen. Click <b>BACK</b> to return to the classroom. Click <b>HOW?</b> to learn more about implementing the concept in your own classroom.</li>
            <li>Once you are on the <b>HOW</b> section, the bottom right hand corner will display two options. Click <b>BACK</b> to return to the classroom. Click <b>WHAT?</b> to learn more about how the thing you clicked shows cultural responsiveness</li>
            <li>Click the <b>LOOK CLOSER</b> and <b>LOOK AROUND</b> buttons on the bottom right and left corners of the screen respectively to switch between the room view and whiteboard view.</li>

        <p>We, as teachers, are constantly on a journey to improve our practice, and cultural responsiveness is a focus for many of us. Something that I have personally found challenging so far in my teaching journey, is making cultural responsiveness visible in my classroom, and it’s an area that I am consistently working on improving. (Would you benefit from additional resources around what cultural responsiveness/”culture counts” looks like in your classroom?)</p>
        <p>After analysing the results of my observations over the year, I noticed that my biggest challenge by far is reaching the “Culture Counts” criteria in our school-wide pedagogy reflection tool. The “Culture Counts” section consists of the following goals:
          <ul>
            <li>tikanga and te reo Māori is authentically linked to learning</li>
            <li>culturally responsive learning contexts promote reciprocal learning and value diverse perspectives</li>
            <li>cultural identity is authentically valued and integral to learning</li>
            <li>classroom environment authentically reflects cultural diversity and is integrated with the learning. (Hamlin, 2018)</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>I started investigating into the issue: why was I finding it so difficult to integrate cultural responsiveness into the classroom? It’s not like I DIDN’T value my learners and their identities. After collaborating with my in-school mentor, head of learning area, and other teachers at my school and in the teach first program, I discovered that the biggest challenge for me was not actually completing these tasks, but completing them in a way that is visible to my learners and others around them.</p>
        <p>To put it simply, I didn’t know what “culturally responsive pedagogy” actually looked like.</p>
        <p>Once I discovered that that was my issue, I decided to look into my theory. When asked, 89.7% of Papatoetoe High School teachers stated that they would benefit from additional resources around what cultural responsiveness looks like in the classroom. In addition to that, I received multiple comments from teachers highlighting their own lack of understanding around integrating tikanga and te reo Māori in an authentic way, with a particular focus on their own subject areas (Petersen, 2018).</p>
        <p>My next step was to look at possible solutions to the problem - what could I achieve (in a timely fashion) that would most benefit these teachers - and myself - in our journey to culturally responsive pedagogy?</p>
        <p>I considered writing an example unit that included Māori contexts, but that wouldn’t necessarily help teachers of other subjects. I eventually settled on the below project, “Culturally Responsive Classroom”.</p>
        <p>I tried to make it as accessible as possible by creating it in HTML5 canvas, but I will struggle to engage teachers, like many at my school, who do not enjoy engaging in a digital way. In contrast though, I will be able to reach a much greater audience than just my school by creating it online.</p>
        <p>It is incredibly important to me, as a significant adult in the lives of my learners, that I embody these values and express that I value the diverse perspectives and individuals that I have in my classroom. Everybody deserves to have their culture and identity acknowledged and valued, and through “Culturally Responsive Classroom” I aim to support teachers around the world in their journey to create visibly responsive environments.</p>
