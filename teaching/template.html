      <h2>FULL STEAM AHEAD - SEMESTER ONE, 2016</h2>
      <div class="w3-justify">
        <p>My first semester of 2016 was nothing short of hectic. Between classes and assignments, PASS and student voice, programme committee and industry events, I had very little time to spare. I immensely enjoyed all of these things, but I&#39;m loving the chance to relax and breathe now that it&#39;s the holidays. I&#39;m sure next semester will be just as exciting and I know that I need to be prepared as possible to meet it head on!</p>
        <p>The class I most enjoyed this semester was Best Programming Practices in .NET. The content was both challenging and satisfying, and I especially loved being given the chance to build entire functional systems on my own. My favourite assignment involved building a word processor from scratch and producing a relevant user manual. Going through my code and providing exception handling was the most exciting part of that assignment for me as finding potential issues and loopholes inside my code made me think critically about the work I produced.</p>
        <p>I found Database Management Systems challenging, although I recognise its relevance in software engineering. It&#39;s something that I&#39;d definitely like to study more in the future and work on implementing into my own software. The most interesting part for me was learning about RSA key pair systems. It was fascinating learning about the application of keys and how these security systems work. MySQL was very fun to learn and I continue to experiment with it now in my personal projects, as well as in the future in my studies.</p>
        <p>PASS took up a great deal of my time. It was extremely rewarding watching my students working hard and achieving more highly than they ever thought possible. I&#39;m pleased to recognise that my passions in education have continued to grow, and hopefully my time in PASS will help me to do some good in the education sector in the future. PASS lesson planning was time consuming and challenging, mostly because it required me to be creative in my teaching strategies as well as ensuring that the material was adequately covered. I got lots of great feedback at the end of the semester from my students and I can&#39;t wait to start up again next semester!</p>
        <p>The student voice, as always, was very close to my heart this semester. I spent a lot of time focussing on my MIT Apparel initiative which is still slowly progressing. After carrying out a survey across the entire institute with over 300 replies, I was rewarding with a resounding &#34;yes please!&#34; from my peers. With some luck, my survey will hold enough sway to get the ball rolling with the higher ups! I also worked on organising printing and designs on my own, but eventually left it up to a meeting with marketing to discuss our options. Since our meeting, I&#39;ve had time to think it over, and with any luck, we&#39;ll get apparel up and running before I finish my studies. While this was my main focus, the student voice has been super busy with all sorts of other issues ranging from unsatisfactory lecturers to cleaning conditions, and I&#39;m sure that SEV will dominate a large portion of time for the rest of the year.</p>
        <p>The programme committee have been hard at work developing their new IT programmes and I have been extremely lucky to be involved in the process as a student liaison. While not much is confirmed yet, and I am unable to discuss a lot of it, it has now been publicly confirmed that we will be moving into an eight-week delivery system. As it currently stands, full-time students take four papers over a period of 16 weeks, twice per year. As of next year, this will be changed to four blocks of eight weeks, each containing two papers. I&#39;m not sure how this will impact my workload and my wellbeing as of now, but I look forward to seeing how the change impacts us students.</p>
        <p>I was lucky enough to go to a few industry events this semester &#45; two run by She#, and the other by microsoft. The first was an evening with representatives from google at GridAKL. We learned about unconscious bias in the tech industry and it was awesome to meet many new people &#45; I even scored a google beanie! The second was an evening to check out the current initiatives of local tech companies. There, we were among the first in New Zealand to trial the Microsoft Hololens, as well as speaking to industry representatives from Trademe, Spark, and Orion Health. I attended the MSA (Microsoft Student Accelerator) Imagine Cup finale event at the Auckland Town Hall early in the semester. While the event wasn&#39;t quite what I expected, it was fun to go to, and I was extremely impressed at the work that students like me had been able to accomplish in the space of a few months.</p>
        <p>My personal projects have been going well. I&#39;ve spent a lot of time developing a Guild Wars 2 World vs World application over the past few months. It&#39;s shaping up well and will be ready to release by the end of the year. I spent a full two days working on getting the API access to function correctly, and I am extremely proud of what I accomplished.</p>
        <p>In my spare time, I&#39;ve been playing quite a bit of airsoft with my boyfriend and have really enjoyed my downtime with him. After playing a lot of CQB (Close-quarter battles) we moved into outdoor arenas and have been playing at WAR in Waiuku for a while now. I&#39;ve decided that I much prefer playing outdoors, even if it does require a lot more running over a long period of time. I haven&#39;t had the opportunity to play as much as I&#39;d like, but after I&#39;ve bought a car at the end of the year, it should be a lot easier. I&#39;ve also been spending a bit of time working on Pokemon Red completion, and just finished rereading the Harry Potter series.</p>
        <p>Next semester is bound to be just as busy as this one, but I&#39;m looking forward to it all the same. I&#39;m exactly half-way through my degree now &#45; not long to go!</p>
