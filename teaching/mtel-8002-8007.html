        <p>Use excerpts from your portfolio, as well as examples of feedback from multiple sources to provide evidence of competency in your educational practice, leadership and your reflective capacity. This assessment should provide a narrative connecting your LAA and other feedback, reflection on evidence (including your own reflections on practice), with portfolio evidence including: student work, planning, PLD learning, and records of professional conversations with your learning progression as a teacher. This assessment seeks to evaluate your educational practice and your ability to engage in critical reflection.</p>
        <h3>12.1 & 13.1 Formative Assessment</h3>

        <p><strong>Marker's Notes: </strong>Kia ora Jess, this is a clear summary of the highlights from your practice, and how it has developed since this time last year. You are incorporating contemporary pedagogical knowledge into your teaching well and asking relevant questions to critically reflect. It would be interesting to explore the concept of 'deep learning' further, as you mention in your peer teaching exercise it seemed as if some of the outcomes were quite surface - how could you mitigate this while maintaining the collaborative element? You have also been clear in your application of situational leadership and how this has supported your development, it will be great to see how this is developed on a wider scale through the implementation of your 9000 project, be sure to document and include these experiences in your next formative submission. Overall it is wonderful to see the difference you are making in the classroom Jess, well done!</p>
        <h3>12.2 & 13.2 Formative Assessment</h3>
        <embed src="files/8002-8007_12.2-13.2.pdf#toolbar=0&navpanes=0&scrollbar=0&view=FitH" type="application/pdf" width="100%" height="600px"/>
        <p><strong>Marker's Notes: </strong>Kia ora Jess, thank you for sharing your formative submission. You have met all areas of the rubric, however there are some areas that require consistent attention to detail. In particular is the depth at which you reflect on your teaching approaches, we really like the way that you linked TapasƒÅ with differentiation, and covered the topic of gamification but there needs to be further exploration into why it didn't work for some learners and what you could have done in your practice, based on evidence or theory that would have improved the outcomes for these learners. Digging deeper into the leadership theory that supports your practice would also create a more substantial report on your practice. You are certainly on track to meet the assessment criteria for this course but you can push your learning further by investigating with a more critical lens. Great work Jess, we hope you have a good term two!</p>
