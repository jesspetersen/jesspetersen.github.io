      <div class="w3-justify">
        <p><ul>
          <li>Critically evaluate the interplay between pedagogical knowledge and teaching practice informed by tangata whenuatanga by devising innovative and effective classroom learning strategies</li>
          <li>Critically analyse teaching practice in the bi-cultural, multicultural, social, political, economic, historical, environmental and legal contexts of Aotearoa New Zealand</li>
          <li>Communicate effectively and collaboratively with key learning communities for the purpose of effective management of a teaching and learning setting which is inclusive and physically, socially, culturally, and emotionally, safe</li>
          <li>Critically evaluate the importance of the Attitudes, Code Principles and Standards that are essential as a professional teacher in Aotearoa New Zealand</li>
        </ul></p>
        <h2 class="w3-container w3-pink">3.0 Presentation</h2>
        <p>Make a presentation in which you share practice and theory informed innovative and effective classroom learning strategies regarding tangata whenuatanga and how this informs your developing evidence-based teaching philosophy. In it, critically analyse some of the key, or more of the, bicultural, multicultural, social, political, economic, historical, environmental and legal contexts of teaching and learning in Aotearoa New Zealand, and relate this to your learning setting. Consider collaborative relationships with key learning communities for the purpose of effective management of a learning setting which is inclusive and physically, socially, culturally, and emotionally, safe and critically evaluate attitudes, Code Principles and Standards that are essential as a professional teacher in Aotearoa New Zealand.</p>

        <p><strong>Marker's Notes: </strong>Kia ora Jess. You are open and reflective about your teaching philosophy and the reality of the situation as a teacher in a low decile environment. The discussion of Te Tiriti o Waitangi and the context of tangata whenuatanga is also detailed, open and honest. You are obviously extremely passionate about the artifact and the impact that it has made on your learners and others in the wider community. This assessment could have been strengthened through including a more explicit description of the artifact itself in order to give the audience a more in-depth understanding of the social change you are aiming to achieve. Well done Jess this is a really strong assessment and a great example of an artifact that is capable of contributing to change within the education community.</p>
        <h2 class="w3-container w3-pink">4.0 Artifact</h2>
        <p>Create an approved artifact that demonstrates the creation and dissemination of professional knowledge relating to the success of tangata whenuatanga, with a focus on the learning, the social and cultural context, the well-being of your learners, as well as maintaining learning environments which are collaborative, inclusive and safe. Your artifact will be based on the needs of your learners and/or community as identified through either the Spirals of Inquiry or Teaching as Inquiry models or another evidence informed justification method. It will build upon and contribute to the development of your evidence-based teaching philosophy which you will discuss in assessment #3.0.</p>

        <p><strong>Marker's Notes: </strong>This submission is a perfect example of an innovative and creative way of meeting the needs of your learners through supporting staff and peers in understanding what a 'culturally responsive classroom looks like'. Your ideas are well supported by relevant theory and feedback from your target audience and you have also done well to critique your original practice. Overall this is a wonderful effort and we encourage you to share this with your peers and teaching colleagues.</p>
        <h2 class="w3-container w3-pink">5.0 Collaboration</h2>
        <p>Demonstrate authentic collaboration through providing evidence of your interactions with your peers, colleagues and relevant learning communities. In your submission you will upload five pieces of evidence of this collaboration on the 8003, Society and Learning course. Each of these will be accompanied with explanations highlighting how your evidence show that you have shared knowledge, contributed to substantive decision making, built consensus, contributed links to course materials, and shared your own personal experiences. This will mainly consist of evidence of collaboration with your MTEL peers, however it may also extend to wider professional and community based education groups.</p>

        <p><strong>Marker's Notes: </strong>Kia ora Jessica, you share some detailed, relevant and interesting examples of positive interactions and it is implicit that these have impacted your decision making and professional knowledge. However, you don't include explanations to support how these examples show your developing professional knowledge or their links to the course. You should fully explain the significant of these examples through some detailed reflective accompanying explanations.</p>
