   There is one web design class if you choose it for level 2. And in my opinion you won't regret taking it as it is very enjoyable. It lets you be creative and make websites the way you see fit. The page "About the website" just tells you the courses you will take, how many credits it is, and a brief explanation on each course. <b>If you would like to read more about web design and how it works click the button underneath. </b></p>
