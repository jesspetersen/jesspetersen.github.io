<p id="thirdpage"> Jobs in New Zealand that require web design is in high demand at this moment. With it having a good pay and a lot of opportunities you won’t regret it if you take web design for level 2. Personally, this year web design has been my favorite subject from all five. It seems like it’s very hard and complicated but really its’s not. Resources have all been given to you online as well as your teacher for web design level two is really good. With web design its not always individual work as you can share and discuss ideas with your classmates and friends. This makes web design more enjoyable and you become more eager to start your work   </p>

<p id="p3para"> This year web design has been the subject i look forward to the most out of the five. it’s really fun if you are looking into a career of making websites. Not just that the teacher for DTW2 is also my favourite teacher this year (Miss P). With her as your teacher you can almost guarantee a excellence in each internal that you will do. Out of the three internals i have done this year this one that i am doing right now was my favourite. As it let me be creative and make a website promoting any course i wished from the school. In my opinion all three internals are very very easy to get a merit or excellence as long as you know what is needed to be done. W3 schools is a very good website to learn HTML and CSS and is a website i used to help me complete this internal.</p>
