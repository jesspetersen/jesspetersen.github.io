											<h3>Saviour of Katar</h3>
										</header>
										<p>Saviour of Katar was my first serious project as a Bachelor of ICT student. Complete with an agile plan guiding my actions and forcing me to commit to deadlines, I was challenged in ways unlike I had ever been before. Upon completion and assessment, I was given a grade of 39/40 (A+) for this project. </p>
										<p>The game is inspired from my love of simple turn-based strategy games, such as Nintendo's Pokemon and Final Fantasy series. Being able to manage your resources, in this case, health points, is a valuable skill for any young person to learn, and combined with the need to carefully balance efficiency and risk-taking through the abilities players choose to use, I had an ideal set of goals in mind. </p>
										<ul>
											<li>- Users had to <b>enjoy</b> themselves when playing the game and have a sense of accomplishment upon completion. This was the <i>most important</i> goal for my game.</li> <br />
											<li>- Users would have to carefully consider which skill to use each turn – they had to weigh up whether a risk was worth it and actually <b>think</b> about how to defeat the monster without dying themselves.</li> <br />
											<li>- Users are actually able to complete the game. It was imperative that the game was balanced in a way that allowed player to win – a game is only exciting if it is challenging but <b>doable</b>.</li> <br />
										</ul>
										<p>The project required me to use all sorts of skills and resources that I had never used before, or only very rarely. I had to learn how to use Adobe Flash and Audacity while simultaneously experimenting with Action Script 3. I had all sorts of issues, especially earlier on in the project where I was unable to place any elements on the background (stage). Though disappointed, I pushed through, researched my many error codes and gradually returned my code to a working state. A serious hurdle was the lack of access I had to the software while at home – I was forced to innovate ways to work around this and ensure that all of my time in the lab was spent efficiently. After a short period of time I discovered a trial version of Adobe Flash CS6 was available, which contributed greatly to my flexibility in working on the project.</p>
										<p>Saviour of Katar pushed me to my limits at times, both mentally and emotionally, but through hard work and dedication I was able to pull through and produce something I initially never would have dreamed I was capable of. I immensely enjoyed the challenges of working on this project and I feel that I gained many valuable skills that will benefit me substantially in the future. So, without further ado, I present to you: <b>Saviour of Katar</b>!</p> <br /> <br />
