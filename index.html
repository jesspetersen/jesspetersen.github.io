            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                I am a nineteen-year-old Bachelor of Information and Communications Technology student from Auckland, New Zealand. I have a huge passion for IT and the challenges it brings. I pride myself on my ability to create innovative solutions, especially to difficult problems. I work very hard to achieve results far beyond expectations and my excellent organisational skills help me to avoid losing focus of my goals. 
				<br />
				<br />
				I am particularly interested in gaming, especially Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Games (MMORPGs) and Real-Time Strategy (RTS) games, and spend a lot of my free time absorbed in a fictional world. I aspire to, one day, be involved in the creation or maintenance of a role-playing video game.

        <h2>Abilites & Accomplishments</h2>
            <p>
                I have studied <b>C#</b> for two semesters so far, and have a good grasp of the language and how to implement it. <b>XML</b> was also used in my most recent semester for creating interfaces and I have spent many hours working on <b>HTML & CSS</b> in my own time, 
				specifically producing and maintaining this website. I continue to experiment with other languages of interest such as <b>Python</b> and a small amount of both <b>Clojure</b> and <b>Action Script 3</b>.
            <br />
			<br />
                I recently undertook an individual project to create a short and simple <b>flash</b> role-playing game. It required a multitude of skills and introduced several new concepts to me including <b>agile methodologies</b> and the use of <b>creative commons</b> and public domain for resources. The project represents 
				a significant investment of my time and hard work, taking over 52 hours to complete. I am proud of what I accomplished with the project and you can play the game, or find supporting documentation <a href="portfolio.html#SoK">here</a>.
