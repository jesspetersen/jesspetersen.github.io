            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                I am a nineteen year old Bachelor of Information and Communications Technology student from Auckland, New Zealand. I have a huge interest in gaming, especially MMORPGs and RTSs. Here's more nonsense and stuff because I need more text to fill up this gap for now. I'll change it later when I have the chance.

        <h2>My Life and Family</h2>
            <p>
                I live at home with my five-year-old sister, Samantha, my ten-year-old brother, Benjamin, my mother, Margaret, and the family mouse, Spirit. My little brother and sister are very cheeky and silly, but I still love them very much. They try their hardest at school and sometimes bring home pictures and stories for me, and tell me all about their day. Mum works hard studying social services. She's very kind and loving, and she tries her best with what we have.

                My boyfriend jake comes over often too. He almost lives at my house sometimes! He is very kind and sweet, even if he's silly and a total butthead sometimes. We like to play games together, and I'm great at destroying him in games we play!
