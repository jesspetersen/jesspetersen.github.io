			<h3 class="blog-date">21/12/2015</h3><h3>A Year in Review</h3>
				<p>The beginning of this year marked a huge milestone for me &#151; my first steps onto the rollercoaster
				of emotions, challenges and achievements that is university. In just twelve short months, I&#39;ve spent countless 
				hours working on assignments, attending classes, and working through unexpected issues; all of these 
				challenges culminating in a growing bank of knowledge and experience which will benefit me for years to come. 
				Not only have I developed some solid foundational skills in software engineering, but I have established a 
				vast range of other proficiencies in technological fields, personal and interpersonal areas.</p>
				<p>The biggest personal and academic improvement I achieved this year was my sense of time management. 
				During my high school years, I often struggled to motivate myself adequately to complete assignments in a 
				time-effective manner, sometimes not even starting them until a week before their due date. This trap of 
				procrastination led me to experience unneeded stress and drastically impacted my ability to achieve at a 
				high standard. This year I have made a huge effort in making sure that work and assignments are completed 
				in a timely fashion through the use of a planner, and breaking assignments into smaller, more easily achieved, 
				tasks. I am proud to say that over the course of this year, almost every assignment was complete at least a 
				week before it was due, leaving me less stressed and able to cope with the fast-paced atmosphere of university better.</p>
