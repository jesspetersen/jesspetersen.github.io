      <h2>TEACH FIRST NZ: WILD HOPES AND CHASING DREAMS</h2>
      <div class="w3-justify">
        <p>I found the organisation that changed my life by chance.</p>
        <p>It wasn&#39;t until just before my twenty-first birthday that I began thinking about what I really wanted to do after spending three years of my life engaged in my degree. I love software engineering. I truly do. There&#39;s always just been something about it that I wasn&#39;t sure about. To me, software is about making the lives of our people and communities stronger, and more enriching. It&#39;s about creating a better world to live in, and I wasn&#39;t sure that going straight into software industry was the best way to make achieve that goal.</p>
        <p>I found myself aimlessly scrolling through GradConnection NZ, a website that collates opportunities for new graduates. <i>There has to be something here for me</i>, I remember thinking to myself. I scrolled past organisations such as banks and law firms - sure these are valuable institutions, but they didn&#39;t stand out to me as important for community outreach. It wasn&#39;t until the bottom of this list that I found Teach First NZ.</p>
        <p>See, something inside me had always wanted me to be a teacher. I spent my childhood as an only child, creating fake lessons for my soft toys and scolding them for late homework. My later years were often spent aiding my peers in homework, and I worked as a mentor and tutor during my tertiary education. More than that, I found that school was the home of my heart. Despite the challenges I had faced in my past, school was a place that I could always go to be grounded. My teachers were some of my earliest and strongest role models. The classroom was where I felt most powerful and confident.</p>
        <p>Somewhere along the way I had lost my desire to be a teacher. Lost isn&#39;t necessarily the right word, but I definitely pushed it aside, dismissing it in the same way that my friends and family did, as too stressful, too uncontrollable, and with too low of a salary. My dreams turned to serving the community in other ways - joining a non-profit organisation that aims to prevent domestic violence, or working in a soul-sucking job while spending my free time working on personal projects for people in the community.</p>
        <p>It wasn&#39;t until I looked into the Teach First NZ programme that I realised where my heart truly was. I read about inspiring teachers and aspiring leaders - Jeremy Downing (C15), Rebecca Hines (C17) were particularly interesting, and I watched their vlogs hungrily. Something about the organisation, and what it stood for (reducing educational inequality in New Zealand communities) had hooked me, and I couldn&#39;t stop thinking about it. I began my application the next day.</p>
        <p>The first part of the application process was simple. I wrote a list of my achievements and passions. I wrote about my time as a Student Voice committee member, and my time as a PASS Facilitator. I stretched my brain to include anything I could possibly think of that could be relevant enough to put in my application. I clicked &#34;send&#34; over a fortnight after I had started compiling my application, and hoped with all my heart that I would get a call back.</p>
        <p>Three days later, I received an invitation to a phone interview with Liam Munday, a member of the recruitment team for the next day. Ecstatic, I called my mum immediately and let her know the good news. I knew it wasn&#39;t guaranteed by any means, but I was one step closer to my dream. I had never had a phone interview before, or even prepared for one. I had no idea what to expect so I hid in my room an hour before my interview, with a coffee and Harry Potter playing on the television to calm my nerves. The interview went incredibly well. I found that Liam was friendly and easy to talk to, and as the conversation went on I became more and more open in what I shared. When I was asked about what my three most prominent achievements were, I drew a blank. I went into a panic, weighing my schoolwork against my committee work, hoping for the best reception. It took me a second to collect myself and answer honestly. My journey with my family is what I am most proud of. Working together to survive domestic violence and having nowhere to live, getting help from the government and trying to bring up my little brother and sister in a single-parent home. My mum was my rock and together we were able to pull through everything life had thrown at our little family. We found a house, and I got into polytech. Mum went to study at Te WƒÅnanga o Aotearoa. That was what I was most proud of. Our resilience and strength to rise above the odds.</p>
        <p>I was worried for the next few days that I had blown my opportunity. I didn&#39;t want to be another sob story, I wanted to be accepted for my strengths and achievements. I thought that what I had shared would stop me from going any further in the application process. I was wrong.</p>
        <p>A week later, I was sent an invitation to an &#34;Assessment Centre&#34; day. Overwhelmed with joy, I once again called mum in the middle of her school day to tell her the news. At this point I was getting nervous. I had to keep telling myself to not get too carried away, and to not hold onto a hope that I might be let down on. At the same time, I couldn&#39;t stop myself watching teaching vlogs on youtube and researching NCEA achievement standards. I was so ready.</p>
		<p>Preparation for the Assessment Centre went fairly well. I spent some time researching educational inequality in New Zealand and the initiatives that were working to combat it. Mum took me shopping at The Warehouse and K-Mart for some nice clothes. </p>
		<p>On Friday 5 May, I walked into the Deloitte building in Auckland city, ready for my day. I had never been in such a big building before, and I had to watch the people around me to work out how to use the elevators. I had to take a deep breath before I went into the interview room. It was bigger than I expected, and a whole section of the floor had been set aside for the Teach First NZ day. I made a quick coffee and sat down to chat with the other participants - some who looked as nervous as I felt. We were herded into a room with a panel of ten adults. It wasn&#39;t as intimidating as I had initially thought. With my new friends next to me, we were introduced to a few members of the Teach First NZ team and the rest of the panel.</p>
		<p>The first exercise was simple. We had to work as a team to make a single decision based on information that was given to us. Unfortunately, we were not allowed to settle it by a vote and the decision had to be unanimous. We all had to collaborate in a discussion and make our voices heard to make the decision. Even though we hadn&#39;t actually made a final decision in the end, we felt it went fairly well.</p>
		<p>The rest of the afternoon was split into three individual sessions - an interview about our research into educational inequality, an interview about our general skills and experiences, and a sample teaching lesson.</p>
		<p>My first session was an interview in regards to educational inequality. The interview went well, and the questions that were provided to me before the day were extremely useful in preparing me to answer the interviewer&#39;s questions.</p>
		<p>My second session was the general interview. Despite knowing myself well, the questions that were asked were trickier than I imagined, and I felt quite uncomfortable during the interview. There were a number of times when my throat got so dry from talking that I was choking out my words and had to stop for a few seconds before I could stop coughing! It was going fairly okay until I came across a completely unexpected scenario question. The question was focussed on self-reflection, but I took it a completely different direction, and I knew on leaving the interview that that question may have cost me my chance at my dream. I wish I had focussed on getting myself to relax more inside the interview, because if I had taken the time to breathe and think about the best solution, I would have been able to answer the question better.</p>
		<p>The final session was my sample teaching lesson. I was feeling confident about this session because of my background as a PASS Facilitator and classroom experience. The lesson started easily enough with me writing my learning outcome on the board and preparing my worksheets. After carefully explaining the application of object attributes and methods, I set my students at working on their worksheets. Both students did extremely well, and even though the wrap up was a little wordier than I would have liked, I was pleased with the lesson, on the whole. I was so proud when Ken (an assessor for the day, and principal) commended me on my lesson and classroom management, recognising that I had spent time in the classroom before. After my sample teaching lesson, I was on my way home to await my results.</p>
		<p>Just under two weeks later, I received an offer to be part of Teach First NZ&#39;s Cohort 2018.</p>
		<p>The application process for Teach First New Zealand was lengthy and thorough. It took a lot of effort and preparation, but prepared me well for what is to come. For those who wish to apply to be part of the seven percent of applicants who make it into the Teach First NZ programme, I have the following advice:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Be genuine, be confident, be resourceful. Everyone at Teach First NZ wants you to succeed, and wants to see the best of you. They will give you every chance they can to prove that you have what it takes, you just have to show it to them.</li>
			<li>Don&#39;t be afraid to ask questions. I harassed Steph, Liam, and Emily throughout the entire application process with my endless questions, and they were always friendly, respectful, and more than willing to answer me.</li>
			<li>Have a heart for the people. The most important aspect of Teach First NZ is their commitment to benefitting communities and improving educational outcomes for our children. Wear your heart on your sleeve, and be proud of it.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Something I learned at the 2017 Mid-Year Intensive this weekend was that teaching is not a job for the faint hearted, but the open hearted. Teach First NZ is an organisation that is full of passionate, inspiring, and most of all, loving people, and I can&#39;t wait to start my journey as one of them.</p>
