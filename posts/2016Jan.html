      <h2>THE START OF SOMETHING NEW, JANUARY 2016</h2>
      <div class="w3-justify">
        <p>New year; new you &#151; that&#39;s what they say, isn&#39;t it? In my case, not exactly. While becoming an entirely brand new person sounds like fun, it&#39;s the last thing that I&#39;d want to do. I&#39;m looking forward to using this year to improve myself &#151; work harder, better, and push myself to new heights. January marks the beginning of my second year as a university student, and my first as a software engineer; it&#39;s not a prospect that I take lightly, and I intend on making the most of every opportunity presented to me in the coming year.</p>
				<p>I have a number of goals that I wish to complete this year, and each one has the aim of improving my mental, physical or emotional wellbeing (or a combination of the three). They are:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Excel at university, keeping a semester average of at least an <strong>A-</strong>.</li>
						<li>Continue improving upon my knowledge of software development, and gain an understanding of at least some advanced concepts.</li>
						<li>Become a more active member of the developer community, and attend at least four meetups for like-minded individuals.</li>
						<li>Complete and release my android app, &#34;C# Quick Reference&#34;, on the google play store.</li>
						<li>Take some time each week to relax and do something that I enjoy, like going on a date with my partner or raiding with my guild.</li>
					</ul>
				<p>Progress on my Android app, &#34;C# Quick Reference&#34; has been a little slow this month, and I aim to spend some more time working on it in February. I have really enjoyed the experience so far, and after a few little hiccoughs in initial development where I didn&#39;t really understand how to use Android Studio effectively, I&#39;m off to a good start. My favourite aspect of working with Android Studio is the ability to customise my content. While the drag-and-drop editor is fantastic for layouts, I really enjoy being able to use the XML skills I learned last year to make more complicated edits in the code. Learning Java has been relatively simple &#151;  I have been able to apply many concepts I learned from my time in C#, and while I&#39;m not learning the language comprehensively at the moment, I&#39;ve been able to figure out what is needed to bring my app into a cohesive whole. The most difficult part of developing the app so far has been writing the content. I need to commit to writing more content next month if I intend on releasing the app before the end of the year. </p>
				<p>I gave jesspetersen.net a facelift this month, and I&#39;m super pleased with the results. While my original site (located at site.jesspetersen.net) served the purpose of displaying my portfolio and achievements to the world, I really wanted something more streamlined and attractive. After days of agonising over various drag-and-drop site creators before discovering that the only way to link it to my domain required me to spend money, I eventually settled on an HTML/CSS template. The template was very well documented and I was easily able to alter it to match my needs, changing the initial page to suit each individual section of my site. Even though the new and improved site isn&#39;t entirely of my own creation, I feel much better knowing that it is more professional and presentable to potential employers and colleagues.</p>
				<p>More than anything, I can&#39;t wait to start back at university next month. While working on my personal projects has been a great way to spend the holidays, especially since I&#39;m making relatively good progress, it does start to get boring after a while. Going back to school and working on my education is something that I take great pleasure in, and I love the variety of knowledge as well as being with my friends who have similar interests. </p>
				<p>I&#39;m working hard on my goals and with school just around the corner, I&#39;m more motivated than ever to get some work done &#151; bring on February; bring on my future.</p>
